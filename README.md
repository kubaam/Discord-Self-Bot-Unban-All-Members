# 🛠 **Discord Self-Bot: Unban All Members** 🚫  

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6%2B-blue.svg) ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)  

## 🔥 **Overview**  

This script automates **unbanning all members** in Discord servers where you have **Administrator** or **Ban Members** permissions! 🧑‍💻  

✅ **Automates the unban process** with **discord.py-self**.  
✅ **Displays eligible servers** and asks for confirmation before proceeding.  
✅ **Removes conflicting libraries** to prevent errors.  
✅ **Secure token input** – no token echoing for privacy.  
✅ **Graceful error handling** for smooth execution.  

⚠️ **Important**: This bot **requires your Discord token** to function.  

---

## 🛠 **Features**  

- **🚀 Unban All Members** – Automatically unbans all users from selected servers.  
- **📦 Automatic Setup** – Removes conflicting Discord libraries before installing `discord.py-self`.  
- **🔑 Secure Token Input** – Your token is entered safely without being displayed.  
- **🚫 Built-in Error Handling** – Prevents crashes and ensures a smooth process.  

---

## 📦 **Requirements**  

- **Python 3.6+**  
- **`discord.py-self`** (Installed automatically)  

### **Install Manually** (Optional)  

```bash  
pip install discord.py-self  
```  

*Conflicting libraries like `discord.py` or `nextcord` will be uninstalled automatically.*  

---

## ⚙️ **Setup & Execution**  

### 1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/discord-unban-all-selfbot.git  
cd discord-unban-all-selfbot  
```  

### 2️⃣ **Run the Script**  

```bash  
python main.py  
```  

---

## 🏃‍♂️ **How It Works**  

1. **📦 Auto-Setup** – Uninstalls conflicting libraries and installs `discord.py-self`.  
2. **🔑 Token Input** – Asks for your **Discord token securely** (no echoing for privacy).  
3. **📜 Server List** – Displays servers where you have **unban permissions**.  
4. **✅ Confirmation Step** – Prompts you before unbanning all members.  
5. **🚀 Unban Execution** – Loops through all banned users and removes bans.  

### **Example Output:**  

```bash  
Uninstalling conflicting libraries...  
Uninstalled discord.py  
Installed discord.py-self  
Enter your Discord token (will not echo):  
Logged in as YourBotName  

Servers where you have unban permissions:  
1. Example Server (ID: 123456789)  
2. Another Server (ID: 987654321)  

Enter the number of the server to unban all members: 1  
Are you sure you want to unban ALL members in Example Server? (y/n): y  

Starting unban process...  
Found 20 banned users. Unbanning...  
✅ Unbanned User1#1234  
✅ Unbanned User2#5678  
...  
🎉 Unban process completed!  
```
