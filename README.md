# Discord-Self-Bot-Unban-All-Members
This script automates the process of unbanning all members in servers where you have administrator or ban_members permissions! Once the bot is running, it will display all eligible servers and ask for confirmation before proceeding to unban the members. It's designed to work with discord.py-self and removes any conflicting libraries automatically!
